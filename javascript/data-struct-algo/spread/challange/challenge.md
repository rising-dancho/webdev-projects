# Spread Operator

```Javascript
const initialArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const initialObject = { name: "John", age: 25, country: "USA" };
```

1. Use the spread operator  to create a new array called `modifiedArray` that includes all the elements from the `initialArray` along with an additional element, 6.
2. Use the spread operator to create a new object called `modifiedObject` that includes all the key-value pairs from the `initialObject` along with a new property interests containing an array of interests, such as `['programming', 'music']`.
3. Use the spread operator to create a new array called `combinedArray` that combines the elements from the `initialArray` and a second array, `additionalArray = [6, 7, 8]`.
4. Use the spread operator to create a new object called `mergedObject` by merging the properties from the `initialObject` and a second object, `additionalObject = { occupation: 'developer' }`.
