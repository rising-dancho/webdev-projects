// Your tasks:

// 1.) Create an arrow function calcAverage to calculate the average of 3 scores. 
// This function should have three parameters and return a single number (the average score).

// 2.) Create two new variables â€” scoreDolphins and scoreKoalas, 
// and assign the value returned from the calcAverage 
// function to them (you will need to call this function, and pass scores as arguments).
