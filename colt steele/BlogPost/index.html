            <h1>Typography</h1>
            <p>Typography is one of the most important elements of front end design and development! In this exercise,
                we'll
                play around with some of the common CSS properties to manage and style our fonts by making a nice blog
                post-like web page.

                <h2>All About Typography</h2>

                <p class="headline">
                    Headlines, like this one, are great ways to quickly capture the
                    reader's attention, to give them a sumary, intro, or other important
                    information in a web page. You can use
                    <span>text-transform: uppercase;</span> to make a whole body of text
                    uppercase using CSS if you really need to grab attention!
                </p>
                <p>Okay, now that we're done screaming in the headline in all caps (which you should do sparingly) -
                    it's
                    time to chat more about other components of typography. You'll notice that we chose a nice serif
                    font
                    for our headings, and a nice sans-serif font for our body text. This is intentional! Serif font
                    faces
                    are generally considered pretty inaccessible as a body text style, since at smaller sizes it's much
                    more
                    difficult to visually differentiate the characters from one another. At large font sizes, such as
                    those
                    seen in most headings, serif fonts are considered fine, since the larger style makes it easier to
                    see
                    where serif characters start and where they end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But wait! What if you want more than just normal text on your page? Another common thing you might
                    see
                    in web pages are quotes. To make quotes, we can use the <span class="mono">blockquote</span> element
                    and
                    style it accordingly, so it stands out a bit as a non-body text quote.
                </p>

                <section class="quote">
                    "This is a quote - you probably knew that at a glance since we gave it some nice styling. Pretty
                    nice,
                    huh? A great lesson in User Experience Design, where we take special care to implement our web page
                    in a
                    way that makes it pleasant and intuitive for our users/readers. Differentiating our different
                    typography
                    components visually makes information much more organized and easier to digest for our users."

                <h3>A New Section</h3>

                <p>And just like that, we've got a new section of content separated by a <span class="mono">hr</span>
                    element (a 'horizontal rule' or a divider) and a new heading. Isn't putting content together fun?
                </p>
                <p>Notice as well that when we entered in the H3 content, it was all lowercase, but now it's in a nice
                    Title
                    Case, where the first letter of each word is capitalized. We did that with CSS! Using <span
                        class="mono">text-transform: capitalize;</span> we can implement title cased content.</p>
