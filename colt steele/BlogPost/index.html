            <h1>Typography</h1>
            <p>Typography is one of the most important elements of front end design and development! In this exercise,
                we'll
                play around with some of the common CSS properties to manage and style our fonts by making a nice blog
                post-like web page.

                <h2>All About Typography</h2>

                <p class="headline">
                    Headlines, like this one, are great ways to quickly capture the
                    reader's attention, to give them a sumary, intro, or other important
                    information in a web page. You can use
                    <span>text-transform: uppercase;</span> to make a whole body of text
                    uppercase using CSS if you really need to grab attention!
                </p>
                <p>Okay, now that we're done screaming in the headline in all caps (which you should do sparingly) -
                    it's
                    time to chat more about other components of typography. You'll notice that we chose a nice serif
                    font
                    for our headings, and a nice sans-serif font for our body text. This is intentional! Serif font
                    faces
                    are generally considered pretty inaccessible as a body text style, since at smaller sizes it's much
                    more
                    difficult to visually differentiate the characters from one another. At large font sizes, such as
                    those
                    seen in most headings, serif fonts are considered fine, since the larger style makes it easier to
                    see
                    where serif characters start and where they end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But wait! What if you want more than just normal text on your page? Another common thing you might
                    see
                    in web pages are quotes. To make quotes, we can use the <span class="mono">blockquote</span> element
                    and
                    style it accordingly, so it stands out a bit as a non-body text quote.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    "This is a quote - you probably knew that at a glance since we gave it some nice styling. Pretty
                    nice,
                    huh? A great lesson in User Experience Design, where we take special care to implement our web page
                    in a
                    way that makes it pleasant and intuitive for our users/readers. Differentiating our different
                    typography
                    components visually makes information much more organized and easier to digest for our users."

                <h3>A New Section</h3>

                <p>And just like that, we've got a new section of content separated by a <span class="mono">hr</span>
                    element (a 'horizontal rule' or a divider) and a new heading. Isn't putting content together fun?
                </p>
                <p>Notice as well that when we entered in the H3 content, it was all lowercase, but now it's in a nice
                    Title
                    Case, where the first letter of each word is capitalized. We did that with CSS! Using <span
                        class="mono">text-transform: capitalize;</span> we can implement title cased content.</p>

                <h3>Common Font Sizing Approaches</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="approaches">px</span> (pixels)</li>
                    <p>Pixels are the simplest way to hard code your font size. By default the browser sets the root font
                        size
                        to <code>16px</code>, but you can change the font size in the <code
                            class="code">body</code> element or any other HTML element by setting
                        <code>font-size</code> to any number of <code>px</code>.
                    </p>
                    <li><span class="approaches">em</span></li>
                    <p><code>em</code> units size font relative to the parent element. For example, if the body
                        element is <code>16px</code>, and a nested
                        <code>div</code> element's font size is set to <code>1.5em</code>, the
                        browser will multiply <code>16px</code> x 1.5, resulting in <code
                            class="code">24px</code> font in
                        the <code>div</code>.
                    </p>
                    <li><span class="approaches">rem</span> (root em)</li>
                    <p><code>Root em</code> units are similar to em, but they are relative to the root font
                        size instead of the parent
                        element of whatever is being styled. For example, if the root font size (the font size of the body
                        element) is set to <code>16px</code>, and we have a <code>p</code> element
                        nested many layers down with a <code>font-size</code> set to <code
                            class="code">2rem</code>,
                        that paragraph will have <code>32px</code> font. If the body font size ever changes,
                        this paragraph will also change
                        accordingly.</p>
                </ul>
                <!-- <h4><span>px</span> (pixels)</h4>
                <p>Pixels are the simplest way to hard code your font size. By default the browser sets the root font
                    size
                    to <span class="mono">16px</span>, but you can change the font size in the <span
                        class="mono">body</span> element or any other HTML element by setting
                    <span class="mono">font-size</span> to any number of <span class="mono">px</span>.
                </p>
                <h4><span>em</span></h4>
                <p><span class="mono">em</span> units size font relative to the parent element. For example, if the body
                    element is <span class="mono">16px</span>, and a nested
                    <span class="mono">div</span> element's font size is set to <span class="mono">1.5em</span>, the
                    browser will multiply <span class="mono">16px</span> x 1.5, resulting in <span
                        class="mono">24px</span> font in
                    the <span class="mono">div</span>.
                </p>
                <h4><span>rem</span> (root em)</h4>
                <p><span class="mono">Root em</span> units are similar to em, but they are relative to the root font
                    size instead of the parent
                    element of whatever is being styled. For example, if the root font size (the font size of the body
                    element) is set to <span class="mono">16px</span>, and we have a <span class="mono">p</span> element
                    nested many layers down with a <span class="mono">font-size</span> set to <span
                        class="mono">2rem</span>,
                    that paragraph will have <span class="mono">32px</span> font. If the body font size ever changes,
                    this paragraph will also change
                    accordingly.</p> -->
                <h4>Which one do I use?</h4>
                <p>Great question! Generally, people try to stick to using <span class="mono">em</span> or <span
                        class="mono">rem</span> over <span class="mono">px</span>, since they make responsive
                    typography that scales up and down across different device widths much easier. Using px for your
                    font
                    sizes is not as dynamic, and you may find that writing media queries to update all the various
                    element
                    font sizes in pixels at different screen widths is not the most scalable approach to typography.</p>
                <p>Between <span class="mono">em</span> and <span class="mono">rem</span>, rem has a nice advantage of
                    all elements being relative to one single root font
                    value, where nested elements with parent/child font size dependencies can still be hard to manage
                    with
                    em units. When writing responsive styles, rem allows you to simply update the root font size at
                    different screen sizes and all elements using rem units will adjust themselves accordingly creating
                    a
                    super easy-to-manage typography size system.</p>
                <p>In small projects you may not have an issues hard coding pixelage, but it's always important to
                    understand the drawbacks of writing styles that may not be responsive or dynamic.</p>
