const userProfile = {
  username: "jsdev",
  email: "jsdev@example.com",
  age: 25,
  country: "USA",
  interests: ["web development", "reading", "music"],
};

const retirementAge = 65;

Given the code above, do the following:

Extract the username, email, and interests properties from the userProfile object and assign them to separate variables.
Use the extracted variables to log the user's information as an object.
Extract the age and country properties from the userProfile object and assign them to separate variables.
Use the extracted age variable and calculate the difference between the retirement age and the user's age. Output the result as a string, for example: "Years until retirement: 40".
