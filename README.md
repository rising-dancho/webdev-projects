# webdev-projects

freecodecamp is great but too boring. rather than focusing on what tools do 
i think i'd focus on actually creating projects. seeing what's possible through other people's works 
is extremely inspiring. i'll just do projects and pick-up patterns on how they do things along the way..
that is the plan.
