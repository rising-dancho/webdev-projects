<ul>
  <li>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @adfinem_rising, a.k.a. jose a. perez jr., a peasant, a retard, and a friend :)</li>
  <li>ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding, cooking, entrepreneurship, building and repair</li>
  <li>ðŸŒ± I realized that there's not much jobs in python that are not very "data science-ey." so i'll just be focusing on front-end development instead. and maybe some back-end development on the side whenever i'm feeling quite bold ;)</li>
  <li>ðŸ“« How to reach me @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9cqnX1phxqaaBc2dIX2XlQ">youtube</a> i do some pathetic things there</li>
